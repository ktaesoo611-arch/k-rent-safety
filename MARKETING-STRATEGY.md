🚨 JEONSE SAFETY CHECK: Did you know?

70% of foreigners signing jeonse contracts never check:
❌ Property liens and mortgages
❌ Actual market value vs. deposit amount
❌ Landlord's financial situation
❌ Legal seizures or auctions

I built a FREE tool that analyzes all of this automatically.
Just upload your 등기부등본 (property register) → Get full English report in 2 minutes.

Currently FREE during beta (Seoul apartments only)

Has anyone else been worried about this?

```
📊 REAL CASE STUDY: Why you need to check your jeonse property

Last week someone used our tool and discovered:
- Deposit: ₩200M
- Property value: ₩180M (BELOW deposit!)
- 3 existing mortgages totaling ₩150M
- Safety score: 23/100 (HIGH RISK)

They avoided signing and potentially losing ₩200M.

This is why I created a free jeonse safety checker.
Available now (beta): [link]

Have you checked your property yet?
