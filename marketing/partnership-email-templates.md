Subject: Partnership Opportunity: Protect Your Clients from Jeonse Fraud

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] helps international professionals relocate to Seoul. I'm reaching out because I built a tool that could add significant value to your relocation packages - and help protect your clients from a ₩100M+ mistake.

THE PROBLEM:
- 30% of jeonse deposits in Seoul exceed safe LTV ratios
- Foreigners can't read Korean property registers (등기부등본)
- Jeonse fraud cost foreigners ₩15B+ in 2024 alone
- Your clients are prime targets due to language barriers

THE SOLUTION:
I created an automated jeonse safety analysis tool:
✓ Analyzes Korean property documents in 2 minutes
✓ Generates comprehensive English safety reports
✓ Identifies red flags (mortgages, liens, ownership issues)
✓ Provides risk score and clear recommendations
✓ Currently used by 500+ foreigners in Seoul

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:
I'd like to offer [Company]'s clients:
- Wholesale pricing (₩15,000 per analysis vs. ₩29,000 retail)
- Dedicated support for your team
- Custom-branded reports (optional)
- Priority processing for your clients

This would allow you to:
✓ Differentiate your relocation service
✓ Reduce liability (clients have verified safety)
✓ Build trust with nervous clients
✓ Solve a real pain point

Would you be interested in a 15-minute call to explore this?

I'm happy to provide:
- Free trial for your next 3 clients
- Demo of the platform
- Sample safety reports
- Case studies from existing users

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

**Option B: À La Carte**
₩25,000 per analysis (bulk discount from ₩29,000 retail)
- Pay as you go
- No annual commitment
- Same features

**Option C: Pilot Program (FREE)**
- Free analyses for your next 5 relocating employees
- Gather feedback
- Decide if you want to continue
- No obligation

VALUE TO YOUR ORGANIZATION:
✓ Reduce employee housing stress
✓ Prevent financial disasters (and potential lawsuits)
✓ Differentiate your relocation package
✓ Demonstrate duty of care
✓ Sleep better knowing employees are protected

NEXT STEP:
Would you be available for a 20-minute call to discuss?
