📊 REAL CASE STUDY: Why you need to check your jeonse property

Last week someone used our tool and discovered:
- Proposed deposit: ₩200,000,000
- Property market value: ₩180,000,000 (BELOW deposit! 🚨)
- 3 existing mortgages totaling ₩150,000,000
- Safety score: 23/100 (HIGH RISK)

They avoided signing and potentially losing ₩200M.

This is exactly why I created a free jeonse safety checker.

```
⚠️ 5 JEONSE RED FLAGS Foreigners Must Know

Signing a jeonse contract soon? Watch out for these:

1️⃣ Deposit > 70% of property value
   → Your money is at risk if value drops

2️⃣ Multiple existing mortgages
   → You're last in line if landlord defaults

3️⃣ Recent ownership change (< 6 months)
   → Possible flipping scheme

4️⃣ Landlord won't provide 등기부등본
   → They're hiding something

5️⃣ Pressure to sign quickly
   → Classic fraud tactic

❓ QUESTION: How do you know if your jeonse is safe?

Most foreigners say:
"My real estate agent said it's fine" 🤔
"The apartment looks nice" 🏢
"The landlord seems trustworthy" 👤

But here's the truth:
❌ Agents don't liability
❌ Appearance ≠ Safety
❌ Trust ≠ Verification

What you ACTUALLY need:
✅ Official property register (등기부등본)
✅ MOLIT transaction data
✅ Lien and mortgage check
✅ Market value comparison

I automated all of this in one free tool.

### Post 8: Quick Tip
```
💡 QUICK TIP: The 60-70% Rule

Your jeonse deposit should be MAX 60-70% of the property's market value.

Why?
- Protects you if values drop
- Ensures you're not over-leveraged
- Standard recommended by Korean housing experts

Example:
Property worth ₩300M → Safe deposit = ₩180-210M

Is your deposit higher? 🚨 RED FLAG

### Post 9: Myth Busting

🚫 MYTH vs REALITY: Jeonse Edition

MYTH: "My deposit is protected by Korean law"
REALITY: You're only protected if there's equity left after mortgages are paid.

MYTH: "The real estate agent verified everything"
REALITY: Agents have no legal liability and often don't check thoroughly.

MYTH: "If the apartment is expensive, it's safe"
REALITY: Expensive apartments can have even MORE debt.

MYTH: "I need to hire a lawyer to check"
REALITY: You can check automatically for FREE in 2 minutes.

😰 WORST CASE SCENARIO: What happens if your landlord can't return your deposit?

Here's the brutal truth:

1️⃣ Property gets auctioned
2️⃣ Bank mortgages get paid first
3️⃣ Government fees get paid second
4️⃣ You get whatever's left (if anything)

Real example:
- Your deposit: ₩200M
- Property sells for: ₩250M
- Bank mortgages: ₩180M
- Auction fees: ₩20M
- You receive: ₩50M
- You LOSE: ₩150M 😱

This is why checking mortgages BEFORE signing is critical.

### Post 15: Solution Post

✨ I SOLVED my own jeonse problem (and built a tool for you)

3 months ago, I was terrified about signing my jeonse contract:
- ₩180M deposit (my entire savings)
- Couldn't read Korean documents
- Agent said "don't worry" (not helpful)
- Hiring translator + lawyer = ₩400K+

So I built an automated checker instead.

Now it:
✅ Reads 등기부등본 in Korean
✅ Translates everything to English
✅ Checks MOLIT transaction data
✅ Calculates safety score (0-100)
✅ Explains all risks clearly

And I'm offering it FREE during beta.

Title: [Guide] Complete Jeonse Safety Checklist for Foreigners in Seoul

Body:
After seeing countless posts about jeonse concerns, I wanted to share a comprehensive safety guide.

**CRITICAL CHECKS BEFORE SIGNING:**

1. **Get the 등기부등본 (Property Register)**
   - Go to iros.go.kr
   - Costs ₩700
   - Shows all mortgages, liens, and ownership info

2. **Check These RED FLAGS:**
   - ❌ Total mortgages > 60% of property value
   - ❌ Multiple seizures or provisional seizures
   - ❌ Recent ownership change (< 6 months)
   - ❌ Your deposit > 70% of market value
   - ❌ Owner pressuring you to sign quickly

3. **Verify Property Value:**
   - Use MOLIT website (Korean gov't data)
   - Compare recent transactions in same building
   - Don't trust agent's valuation

4. **Calculate Safe Deposit Amount:**
   - Market value × 0.6 = Maximum safe deposit
   - Example: ₩300M property → ₩180M max deposit

5. **Understand Priority Ranking:**
   If landlord defaults, money goes in this order:
   1. Auction fees
   2. Taxes
   3. Senior mortgages
   4. Your jeonse deposit (you're last!)

**RESOURCES:**
- MOLIT website: rt.molit.go.kr
- Property register: iros.go.kr
- I also built a free automated checker (beta): [link]

**Common Questions:**

Q: "My agent says it's safe, should I trust them?"
A: No. Agents have zero liability. Always verify yourself.

Q: "The building looks expensive, that means it's safe right?"
A: No. Expensive buildings often have MORE debt.

Q: "Do I need a lawyer?"
A: Not necessarily. You can check most things yourself.

Feel free to ask questions! I want to help everyone stay safe.

### Reddit Post 3: Personal Story
```
Title: How I almost lost ₩180M to jeonse fraud (and how you can avoid it)

Body:
Throwaway account because this is embarrassing.

Last year I was signing a jeonse contract for a nice apartment in Gangnam.
Deposit: ₩180,000,000 (literally all my savings + family help)

The apartment was beautiful. The landlord was friendly. My real estate agent said "no problem, very safe!"

I was about to sign.

Then my Korean friend said: "Did you check the 등기부등본?"
Me: "The what?"

Turns out it's the property register showing all mortgages and liens.

What we found:
- Property value: ₩200M (I thought it was ₩300M)
- Existing mortgages: ₩140M
- My deposit: ₩180M
- Total debt would be: ₩320M on a ₩200M property

If the landlord couldn't return my deposit, the banks would get their ₩140M first. I'd get maybe ₩60M back.

I would have LOST ₩120M.

**How to avoid this:**

1. ALWAYS get the 등기부등본 from iros.go.kr (₩1,000)
2. Check total mortgages
3. Verify property value on MOLIT website
4. Your deposit should be MAX 60-70% of value

I ended up building a tool to automate this because the process was so confusing. It's free during beta if anyone wants to check their property: [link]

Please don't make my mistake. Check EVERYTHING before signing.

### Reddit Post 4: Technical Breakdown
```
Title: [Technical] How jeonse safety actually works (with numbers)

Body:
Seeing a lot of confusion about jeonse safety, so here's a technical breakdown.

**The Math:**

Let's say property value = ₩300M

**SAFE scenario:**
- Mortgages: ₩90M (30%)
- Your deposit: ₩180M (60%)
- Total: ₩270M (90% of value)
- Safety margin: ₩30M ✅

**RISKY scenario:**
- Mortgages: ₩150M (50%)
- Your deposit: ₩210M (70%)
- Total: ₩360M (120% of value)
- Over-leveraged by: ₩60M ⚠️

**DANGEROUS scenario:**
- Mortgages: ₩180M (60%)
- Your deposit: ₩200M (67%)
- Total: ₩380M (127% of value)
- You WILL lose money if sold 🚨

**What happens in auction:**

Property sells for ₩270M (usually 10% below market):
1. Auction fees: ₩10M
2. Senior mortgage: ₩180M
3. You get: ₩80M
4. You LOSE: ₩120M

**How to calculate safe deposit:**

```
Safe deposit = (Market value × 0.6) - Existing mortgages
```

Example:
- Market value: ₩300M
- Existing mortgages: ₩90M
- Safe deposit: (₩300M × 0.6) - ₩90M = ₩90M

**Resources:**
- MOLIT price data: rt.molit.go.kr
- Property register: iros.go.kr
- Auto calculator (I built this): [link]

Questions welcome!
```

### Reddit Post 5: Warning Post
```
Title: PSA: Your real estate agent is NOT checking jeonse safety

Body:
This needs to be said loudly:

**YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENT HAS ZERO LIABILITY**

They can say "it's safe" and if you lose money, they have no responsibility.

Many agents:
- Don't check mortgages
- Don't verify property values
- Just trust the landlord
- Want their commission ASAP

This is why 67% of jeonse fraud victims are foreigners who trusted their agents.

**What YOU must do:**

1. Get 등기부등본 yourself (₩1,000 at iros.go.kr)
2. Check MOLIT for recent transactions
3. Calculate LTV ratio yourself
4. Don't sign until YOU verify everything

Yes, it's annoying. Yes, it's in Korean. Yes, it's YOUR money.

Tools that help:
- MOLIT website (gov't transaction data)
- Property register (mortgages and liens)
- Safety calculator [link to my tool]

Rant over. Stay safe everyone.
```

### Reddit Post 6: FAQ Format
```
Title: Jeonse Safety FAQ - Everything you need to know

Body:

**Q: What is the 등기부등본?**
A: Property register showing ownership, mortgages, liens, and legal restrictions. Get it at iros.go.kr for ₩1,000.

**Q: How much should my deposit be?**
A: Maximum 60-70% of the property's market value. Less is safer.

**Q: What's a safe LTV ratio?**
A: (Your deposit + existing mortgages) ÷ property value should be < 80%. Under 70% is ideal.

**Q: My agent says it's safe. Can I trust them?**
A: No. Agents have no liability. Always verify yourself.

**Q: How do I check property value?**
A: MOLIT website (rt.molit.go.kr) has official transaction data. Look for recent sales in the same building.

**Q: What are the red flags?**
A: Multiple mortgages, recent ownership change, deposit > 70% of value, landlord rushing you, won't provide documents.

**Q: Do I need a lawyer?**
A: Not usually. Most checks you can do yourself. Lawyers cost ₩300K+.

**Q: What if I can't read Korean?**
A: Use translation services or automated checkers like [link].

**Q: Is jeonse safe in general?**
A: Yes, if you verify properly. 95%+ of contracts are fine. But the 5% that aren't can cost you everything.

### Reddit Post 7: Discussion Starter
```
Title: How many of you actually checked your jeonse property register before signing?

Body:
Genuine question - I'm curious about the real numbers.

When you signed your jeonse contract, did you:

A) Check 등기부등본 (property register) thoroughly
B) Only glanced at it / had someone translate key parts
C) Relied on agent saying "it's safe"
D) Didn't know this document existed

Also:
- How much was your deposit?
- What district?
- Any issues afterward?

I'm asking because I'm working on making this process easier for foreigners (built a free safety checker during beta: [link]).

Want to understand how big this problem actually is.

No judgment - I almost signed without checking anything!

### Reddit Post 8: News Discussion
```
Title: Another major jeonse fraud case - 47 arrested, ₩89B stolen. Here's how to avoid being a victim.

Body:
Just saw this in the news. Another massive jeonse fraud ring busted.

**The scam pattern:**
1. Buy property with high mortgage
2. Rent to multiple jeonse tenants
3. Total jeonse deposits > property value
4. Stop paying mortgage
5. Property auctioned, tenants lose money

**Why it works on foreigners:**
- Can't read 등기부등본
- Trust real estate agents
- Don't understand Korean banking system
- Don't know how to verify

**How to protect yourself:**

BEFORE signing, verify these 3 things:

1. **Total mortgages**
   - Get 등기부등본 from iros.go.kr
   - Add up all mortgage amounts
   - Should be < 50% of property value

2. **Property value**
   - Check rt.molit.go.kr for recent sales
   - Don't trust agent's valuation
   - Use actual transaction data

3. **Your safety margin**
   - Formula: (Deposit + Mortgages) ÷ Value
   - Result should be < 0.8 (80%)
   - Under 0.7 is much safer

**Red flags:**
- Owner pressuring quick signature
- Won't provide 등기부등본
- Recent ownership change
- Multiple existing tenants
- Deposit > 70% of value

I built a free tool that checks all of this automatically (beta): [link]

Stay safe!

### Reddit Post 9: Comparison Post
```
Title: I checked 100 Seoul jeonse listings. Here's what I found.

Body:
Spent last month analyzing jeonse listings in Seoul to understand safety levels.

**Dataset:**
- 100 apartments
- Districts: Gangnam, Songpa, Mapo, Yongsan, Seodaemun
- Price range: ₩100M - ₩500M
- Source: Zigbang, Naver, Dabang

**Results:**

**SAFE (LTV < 70%):**
- 42% of listings
- Average deposit: ₩180M
- Average mortgages: ₩80M
- Mostly older buildings

**MODERATE RISK (LTV 70-85%):**
- 39% of listings
- Average deposit: ₩250M
- Average mortgages: ₩120M
- Mix of old and new

**HIGH RISK (LTV > 85%):**
- 19% of listings
- Average deposit: ₩320M
- Average mortgages: ₩200M
- Mostly new/expensive buildings

**Key findings:**

1. Expensive ≠ Safe
   - Highest risk properties were in Gangnam
   - New buildings often have highest mortgages

2. Older buildings often safer
   - Lower mortgages
   - More equity built up

3. Agents don't flag risks
   - Zero listings mentioned LTV ratio
   - None disclosed total debt levels

**How to check your property:**
- Get 등기부등본: iros.go.kr
- Check MOLIT value: rt.molit.go.kr
- Calculate LTV: (Deposit + Mortgages) ÷ Value
- Auto-check: [link to tool]

Happy to answer questions about methodology!

### Reddit Post 10: Success Story
```
Title: Update: Used the community's advice, found a safe jeonse!

Body:
[Original post context]

Quick update for anyone who helped me last month when I was panicking about jeonse safety.

**What I did:**

1. Got 등기부등본 for 5 properties I was considering
2. Checked MOLIT prices for each building
3. Calculated LTV ratios
4. Eliminated 3 properties (too risky)

**Final choice:**
- Property value: ₩280M (recent transaction ₩275M)
- Existing mortgages: ₩60M (21%)
- My deposit: ₩160M (57%)
- Total LTV: 78% ✅
- Safety score: 87/100

**Rejected properties:**
Property A: LTV 127% (would have lost ₩80M+ if landlord defaulted)
Property B: 4 mortgages, recent ownership change (red flags)
Property C: Deposit was 82% of value (too high)

**Total time:** 3 hours to check everything
**Cost:** ₩5,000 (₩1,000 per 등기부등본)
**Peace of mind:** Priceless

Thank you to everyone who shared advice!
