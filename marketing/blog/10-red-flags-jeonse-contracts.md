You're about to hand over ₩100 million to a landlord you just met. In most countries, this would be insane. In Korea, it's Tuesday.

But here's the thing: while jeonse is a legitimate rental system, **jeonse fraud cost foreign renters over ₩15 billion in losses in 2024 alone**. The vast majority of these losses could have been prevented by recognizing warning signs before signing.

This guide covers the 10 critical red flags that should make you walk away from a jeonse contract—no matter how perfect the apartment seems.

## Why Red Flags Matter

The average jeonse deposit in Seoul is ₩150-300 million. For most foreigners, this represents:
- 3-5 years of savings
- Money borrowed from family
- Entire life savings

Losing this deposit isn't just financially devastating—it can force you to leave Korea, abandon your job, and start over. **The time to protect yourself is BEFORE you sign, not after.**

---

## Red Flag #1: Property Value is Lower Than Your Deposit

**What it looks like:**
- You're offering ₩200M deposit
- Property recently sold for ₩180M
- Current market value estimates show ₩190M

**Why it's dangerous:**
This is the #1 sign of jeonse fraud. If the property isn't worth more than your deposit, there's no equity buffer. When the landlord can't return your money, selling the property won't cover your deposit.

**Real case (2024):**
A Canadian teacher in Gangdong signed a ₩250M jeonse for an apartment valued at ₩220M. The building had ₩180M in mortgages. When the landlord disappeared, the auction proceeds were ₩210M. After mortgage holders took their share, the teacher received only ₩30M back—losing ₩220M.

**How to verify:**
✅ Check recent transaction prices on MOLIT website (rt.molit.go.kr)
✅ Compare with Naver real estate estimates
✅ Look at sale prices of similar units in same building
✅ Get professional appraisal if deposit is large

**Safe ratio:**
```
Your Deposit + Existing Mortgages ≤ 70% of Property Value
```

**Action:** If deposit exceeds 80% of property value, WALK AWAY.

---

## Red Flag #2: Multiple Mortgages or High Total Debt

**What it looks like:**
Looking at the property register (등기부등본), you see:
- 3-5 different mortgages from different banks
- Total mortgage amount: ₩300M+
- Property value: ₩400M
- Your deposit: ₩150M

**Why it's dangerous:**
Mortgages have priority over your jeonse deposit in bankruptcy. If total debts exceed 60% of property value, you're in danger.

**Math:**
```
Property value: ₩400M
Existing mortgages: ₩300M (75%)
Your deposit: ₩150M
Total claims: ₩450M

If property sells for ₩400M:
- Mortgage holders get: ₩300M
- You get: ₩100M
- You LOSE: ₩50M
```

**How to check:**
Open the property register and look at the "을구" (Section B) section. Add up ALL mortgages listed.

**Safe threshold:**
- Total mortgages < 50% of property value: ✅ SAFE
- Total mortgages 50-60%: ⚠️ CAUTION (get insurance)
- Total mortgages 60-70%: ⛔ RISKY (high risk)
- Total mortgages > 70%: 🚫 WALK AWAY

**Red flag amplifiers:**
- Mortgages from multiple banks (suggests landlord is desperate)
- Recent mortgages (taken out < 6 months ago)
- Mortgage amounts increased recently
- Second or third mortgages (higher interest = financial stress)

---

## Red Flag #3: Landlord Refuses to Show Property Register

**What it looks like:**
- You ask for the property register (등기부등본)
- Landlord says "don't worry, it's fine"
- Landlord says "you can check it yourself online" but won't provide copy
- Landlord gets defensive or angry
- Agent says "we don't usually show this to foreigners"

**Why it's dangerous:**
The property register is PUBLIC information that costs ₩700 to obtain. Any landlord refusing to provide it is hiding something—mortgages, liens, seizures, or worse.

**This is the #1 behavior predictor of fraud.**

**Real case (2023):**
An American student in Sinchon asked for the property register 3 times. Each time, the landlord made excuses. The student signed anyway (the apartment was perfect). Two months later, the building was seized for unpaid taxes totaling ₩80M. The student lost the entire ₩130M deposit.

**What honest landlords do:**
✅ Provide property register immediately when asked
✅ Explain what's on the document
✅ Answer questions openly
✅ Sometimes provide it proactively before you ask

**Action:** If landlord refuses or delays providing property register, WALK AWAY immediately. No exceptions.

---

## Red Flag #4: Recent Ownership Change (< 6 months)

**What it looks like:**
The property register shows:
- Previous owner: 2018-2024
- Current owner: August 2024
- Today: January 2025 (5 months later)
- Owner is already seeking jeonse tenant

**Why it's dangerous:**
Rapid flipping is a common jeonse fraud pattern:
1. Scammer buys property with large mortgage (90%+ LTV)
2. Immediately seeks jeonse tenant
3. Collects large deposit
4. Stops paying mortgage
5. Bank forecloses within 6-12 months
6. Tenant loses deposit

**Pattern to watch:**
```
Property purchase: ₩300M (with ₩270M mortgage = 90% LTV)
Jeonse deposit collected: ₩200M
Scammer's pocket: ₩200M - ₩30M = ₩170M profit
Bank forecloses after 6 months of non-payment
Tenant loses most/all of ₩200M deposit
```

**How to check:**
Look at the "갑구" (Section A) of the property register for ownership history.

**Safe waiting period:**
- Ownership < 6 months: 🚫 HIGH RISK
- Ownership 6-12 months: ⚠️ CAUTION
- Ownership 1-2 years: ✅ Lower risk
- Ownership 3+ years: ✅ SAFE

**Exception:** If owner provides clear explanation (inheritance, corporate relocation, divorce) and property has low mortgage, it may be okay—but verify the story.

## Red Flag #5: Landlord Discourages Lease Registration

**What it looks like:**
- "Registration isn't necessary, don't worry"
- "It's too much trouble for both of us"
- "We can skip it this time"
- "I'll register it later for you"
- "Foreign tenants usually don't register"

**Why it's dangerous:**
Lease registration (전입신고 + 확정일자) is your ONLY legal protection. Without it:
- ❌ You have no priority claim in bankruptcy
- ❌ You cannot sue for deposit recovery
- ❌ You're not protected by tenant laws
- ❌ Landlord can lease to multiple tenants

**Scammer strategy:**
Collect deposits from 3-4 foreigners for the same property, don't let any of them register, disappear with all deposits.

**Real case (2024):**
A landlord in Mapo collected ₩450M from 3 foreign tenants (₩150M each) for the same apartment. None registered because landlord said "it's optional for foreigners." When all three showed up on move-in day, the landlord was gone. Without registration, police couldn't help.

**Legal requirement:**
You have **14 days from move-in** to register your lease at the district office (구청).

**Action:** If landlord discourages registration, this is FRAUD. Report immediately and walk away.

---

## Red Flag #6: Pressure to Sign Quickly

**What it looks like:**
- "Another person is coming to see it tomorrow, you need to decide now"
- "I need the deposit by end of day"
- "The price goes up if you wait"
- "I can only hold it for 2 hours"
- "Pay a holding deposit now or you'll lose it"

**Why it's dangerous:**
Legitimate landlords want reliable, stable tenants. Scammers want to prevent you from doing proper verification, which takes 2-7 days.

**Verification timeline:**
- Get property register: 1 day
- Review for red flags: 1-2 days
- Get professional analysis: 1-2 days
- Consult with Korean friend/lawyer: 1-2 days
- **Total: 4-7 days minimum**

If landlord won't give you a week to decide on a ₩100M+ decision, they're hiding something.

**Legitimate urgency:**
- Peak season (Jan-Feb, Jul-Aug) = higher competition
- Holding deposit (₩1-5M) to secure property for 1-2 weeks is normal
- But you should still get time to verify before paying full deposit

**Action:** Never pay full jeonse deposit without proper verification period. If pressured, walk away.

---

## Red Flag #7: Cash Payment Requests

**What it looks like:**
- "Can you pay in cash? It's more convenient"
- "Wire transfer has fees, let's use cash"
- "Meet me at my office with cash"
- "I'll give you 10% discount for cash payment"

**Why it's dangerous:**
Cash payments:
- Leave no trace
- Can't be reversed
- Can't be tracked
- Make scams untraceable
- Are often not reported for taxes (suggests dishonest landlord)

**Real case (2023):**
A British teacher paid ₩180M in cash at a coffee shop in Gangnam. The "landlord" provided a contract and keys. The keys didn't work. The "landlord" phone number was disconnected. Police couldn't track the cash. The teacher lost everything.

**Standard practice:**
✅ Bank wire transfer (계좌이체) from your account to landlord's account
✅ Transfer on the same day as contract signing and key handover
✅ Account name must match landlord name on property register
✅ Keep transaction records forever

**Only acceptable cash scenario:**
Small holding deposits (₩1-2M) to secure property during verification period—but get a signed receipt.

**Action:** NEVER pay jeonse deposit in cash. Only bank transfer to verified account.

---

## Red Flag #8: Landlord is Not the Registered Owner

**What it looks like:**
- "I'm managing the property for my father/mother/uncle"
- "The owner is overseas, I have power of attorney"
- "I'm representing the owner"
- Person you meet doesn't match name on property register

**Why it's dangerous:**
You must contract with the actual legal owner. Representatives can:
- Be scammers with fake IDs
- Have revoked power of attorney
- Not have authority to lease
- Collect deposit and disappear

**Verification required:**
If the signer is not the owner, they must provide:
✅ Power of attorney (위임장) notarized by Korean notary
✅ Original owner's ID copy
✅ Reason for representation
✅ Owner's contact information for you to verify directly

**How to verify:**
1. Check property register for owner name
2. Check signer's Korean ID (주민등록증 or 외국인등록증)
3. Names must match exactly
4. If not, demand notarized power of attorney
5. Call owner directly to confirm

**Action:** Strongly prefer dealing with actual owner. If using representative, verify everything and get owner confirmation.

## Red Flag #9: Building Has Multiple Jeonse Scam Reports

**What it looks like:**
- Googling the address shows news articles about jeonse fraud
- Facebook groups have warnings about the building
- Multiple units in same building available for jeonse
- Other tenants mention problems

**Why it's dangerous:**
Jeonse fraud often affects entire buildings:
- Building owner leases 10+ units on jeonse
- Collects ₩2-3 billion total
- Building mortgaged for ₩2 billion
- Owner stops paying mortgage
- All 10+ tenants lose deposits simultaneously

**How to research:**
```
Google search (Korean): "[Building address] 전세사기"
Naver search: "[Building address] + 전세 + 문제"
Facebook groups: Search building address in "Seoul Housing" group
```

**Warning signs:**
- 3+ units in same building available for jeonse
- Similar or identical deposit amounts
- Same agent representing multiple units
- Recent news about the building

**Real case (2024):**
The "Incheon Jeonse Fraud Tower" - one building owner collected ₩2.8B from 18 tenants. All units offered ₩150-200M jeonse at the same time. Multiple foreigners lost everything.

**Action:** Research the building AND the landlord before signing.

## Red Flag #10: Deal Seems Too Good to Be True

**What it looks like:**
- Jeonse deposit 30% below market rate
- Brand new building, suspiciously low deposit
- Includes luxury furniture/appliances not typical
- Much nicer apartment than others in price range
- Agent says "special deal just for you"

**Why it's dangerous:**
In competitive Seoul housing market, legitimate landlords have no reason to offer below-market deposits. If it's too good to be true, it's either:
- A scam to attract victims
- Property has serious problems (mold, noise, structural issues)
- Landlord is desperate (financially struggling)

**Market rates (Seoul 2025):**
- Studio (원룸): ₩80M-₩150M
- 1-bedroom: ₩150M-₩250M
- 2-bedroom: ₩250M-₩400M

If you're offered 20-30% below these rates, investigate why.

**Legitimate reasons for lower deposits:**
✅ Older building (20+ years)
✅ Far from subway (15+ min walk)
✅ Lower floors (semi-basement, 1st floor)
✅ Facing north (less sunlight)
✅ Near highway/noise

**Scam reasons:**
❌ "Landlord needs cash urgently"
❌ "Just for foreigners we like"
❌ "You seem trustworthy, special price"
❌ No clear reason

**Action:** If deal seems too good, do EXTRA verification, not less.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are all jeonse contracts with red flags fraudulent?**
A: No, but red flags indicate elevated risk. 1-2 red flags might be explainable. 3+ red flags usually mean you should walk away.

**Q: What if I already signed and now notice red flags?**
A: If you haven't moved in or registered yet, try to cancel (you may lose holding deposit). If already registered, monitor situation closely, get insurance, and consult lawyer.

**Q: Can I negotiate safer terms if I spot red flags?**
A: You can try (lower deposit, shorter term, insurance requirement), but usually better to find safer property.

**Q: How common is jeonse fraud?**
A: Exact numbers vary, but estimates suggest 2-5% of jeonse contracts have serious risk factors. Most jeonse is safe, but verification is critical.

**Q: What if the agent says red flags are "normal in Korea"?**
A: This is false. High mortgages, recent ownership changes, and registration avoidance are NOT normal. Get a second opinion.

**Q: Is wolse (monthly rent) safer than jeonse?**
A: Yes, wolse has lower risk due to smaller deposit. Consider wolse if you're uncomfortable with jeonse risks.

## Final Thoughts

Jeonse can be safe and cost-effective—**if you verify properly**. The foreigners who lose money are almost always those who:
- Skipped property register review
- Trusted the landlord without verification
- Ignored warning signs
- Felt pressured to sign quickly

**Don't be that person.**

Take 5-7 days to verify. Spend ₩100,000-300,000 on professional analysis if needed. It's cheap insurance on a ₩100M+ decision.

Remember: There are thousands of apartments in Seoul. If one shows red flags, **find a different one**.
