The 등기부등본 (deunggibu deungbon) - or "property register" - is the single most important document when renting or buying property in Korea. It contains everything you need to know about ownership, mortgages, liens, and legal claims on a property.

There's just one problem: **it's entirely in Korean, uses legal terminology, and looks completely overwhelming to foreigners.**

This guide breaks down exactly how to read and understand every section of the 등기부등본, with real examples, translations, and what each piece of information means for your jeonse safety.

## What is 등기부등본?

**Official name:** 등기부등본 (deunggibu deungbon)

- Current legal owner
- All mortgages (근저당)
- Liens and seizures (가압류, 압류)
- Legal claims and restrictions

**Why it matters:**
This document tells you if a property is safe for jeonse. It reveals hidden debts, legal problems, and ownership issues that could cause you to lose your deposit.

## The Three Sections of 등기부등본

Every property register has three main sections:

### 📋 Section A (갑구) - Ownership Rights
- Current and past owners
- Ownership changes and dates
- Seizures (압류)
- Provisional seizures (가압류)
- Legal restrictions

### 📋 Section B (을구) - Collateral Rights
- Mortgages (근저당권)
- Lease rights (전세권)
- Other security interests
- Creditor information

### 📋 Header - Property Details
- Property address
- Property type (apartment, land, etc.)
- Size and specifications
- Building information

Let's examine each section in detail.

---

## Understanding the Header (Property Information)

The top section contains basic property details.

### Example Header (Translated):

```
부동산 등기부등본 (Real Estate Registry Record)

[토지] (Land)
소재지번: 서울특별시 강남구 역삼동 123-45
Location: 123-45 Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul

[건물] (Building)
소재지: 서울특별시 강남구 역삼동 123-45 아파트 101동 503호
Location: #503, Building 101, Apartment, 123-45 Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul

면적: 전용면적 84.95㎡
Area: Exclusive area 84.95㎡
```

### Key Terms:

| Korean | English | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 소재지번 | Location | Property address |
| 아파트 | Apartment | Apartment building |
| 동 | Building | Building number in complex |
| 호 | Unit | Unit/apartment number |
| 전용면적 | Exclusive area | Interior living space (not including common areas) |
| 공급면적 | Supply area | Total area including shared spaces |

### What to Check:
✅ Address matches the property you're viewing
✅ Unit number is correct
✅ Area matches what agent told you

---

## Section A (갑구) - Ownership Rights

This section shows WHO owns the property and any RESTRICTIONS on ownership.

### Example Section A:

```
갑  구  (소유권에 관한 사항)
Section A (Matters concerning Ownership Rights)

순위번호  등기목적        접수           등기원인        권리자 및 기타사항
Rank No.  Purpose      Receipt Date   Cause           Rights Holder & Other Details

1        소유권보존    2018년3월15일   -               소유자: 김철수 (650101-1234567)
         Ownership     March 15, 2018                  Owner: Kim Chul-soo
         Preservation

2        소유권이전    2023년7월20일   2023년7월18일   소유자: 박영희 (750505-2345678)
         Ownership     July 20, 2023   매매            Owner: Park Young-hee
         Transfer                      (Sale)          (purchased July 18, 2023)
```

### Key Terms:

| Korean | English | What it Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 소유권보존 | Ownership preservation | First registration of property |
| 소유권이전 | Ownership transfer | Property was sold/transferred |
| 매매 | Sale | Property sold (normal transaction) |
| 증여 | Gift | Property gifted (inheritance, family) |
| 경매 | Auction | Property sold at auction (RED FLAG) |
| 상속 | Inheritance | Inherited property |

### What to Look For:

✅ **Good signs:**
- Current owner held property 2+ years
- Transfer was "매매" (normal sale)
- No recent changes

⚠️ **Warning signs:**
- Owner held property < 6 months (flip risk)
- Multiple ownership changes in short time
- Transfer was "경매" (auction - previous owner lost property)

🚫 **Red flags:**
- 가압류 (provisional seizure) - property being claimed by creditor
- 압류 (seizure) - property frozen by court
- 경매개시결정 (auction initiation) - property being auctioned NOW

### Example Red Flag Entry:

```
3        가압류        2024년12월1일   서울중앙지방법원  채권자: ABC은행
         Provisional   Dec 1, 2024     Seoul Central     Creditor: ABC Bank
         Seizure                       Court             Amount: ₩50,000,000
```

**Translation:** ABC Bank has a ₩50M claim and has frozen the property pending legal proceedings.

**Action if you see this:** 🚫 WALK AWAY - property has serious legal issues.

---

## Section B (을구) - Mortgages and Collateral

This is the MOST IMPORTANT section for jeonse safety. It shows all debts secured by the property.

### Example Section B:

```
을  구  (소유권 외 권리에 관한 사항)
Section B (Matters concerning Rights other than Ownership)

순위번호  등기목적        접수           등기원인        권리자 및 기타사항
Rank No.  Purpose      Receipt Date   Cause           Rights Holder & Other Details

1        근저당권설정   2023년7월25일  2023년7월25일   채권최고액: ₩180,000,000
         Mortgage      July 25, 2023  근저당권설정     채권자: 국민은행 강남지점
         Established                  contract        Creditor: Kookmin Bank Gangnam
                                                      채무자: 박영희
                                                      Debtor: Park Young-hee

2        근저당권설정   2024년5월10일  2024년5월10일   채권최고액: ₩70,000,000
         Mortgage      May 10, 2024   근저당권설정     채권자: 신한은행 역삼지점
         Established                  contract        Creditor: Shinhan Bank Yeoksam
                                                      채무자: 박영희
                                                      Debtor: Park Young-hee
```

### Key Terms:

| Korean | English | What it Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 근저당권설정 | Mortgage established | Bank loan secured by this property |
| 채권최고액 | Maximum credit amount | Maximum debt this mortgage covers |
| 채권자 | Creditor | Who holds the mortgage (usually bank) |
| 채무자 | Debtor | Who owes the money (property owner) |
| 전세권설정 | Jeonse right | Previous jeonse tenant registered their lease |
| 말소 | Cancellation | Mortgage/lien was paid off and removed |

### How to Calculate Total Debt:

Add up ALL "채권최고액" amounts in Section B:

```
Mortgage 1: ₩180,000,000
Mortgage 2: ₩ 70,000,000
─────────────────────────
Total:      ₩250,000,000
```

### Safety Formula:

```
Property Market Value: ₩400,000,000
Existing Mortgages:    ₩250,000,000 (62.5%)
Your Jeonse Deposit:   ₩150,000,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Total Claims:          ₩400,000,000 (100%)
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- Total mortgages < 50%: ✅ SAFE
- Total mortgages 50-60%: ✅ Generally safe
- Total mortgages 60-70%: ⚠️ CAUTION (get insurance)
- Total mortgages > 70%: 🚫 HIGH RISK

**In this example:** 62.5% mortgages + your deposit = 100% of value = ⚠️ RISKY

### What "채권최고액" Actually Means

**Important:** 채권최고액 is the MAXIMUM amount, not necessarily the current debt.

**Example:**
- 채권최고액: ₩180,000,000
- Actual loan: Might be ₩120,000,000-₩180,000,000

**Conservative approach:** Assume 채권최고액 = actual debt for safety calculations.

### Multiple Mortgages - Why It Matters

**One mortgage (1순위):**
```
1st Mortgage: ₩250M
─────────────────
Total: ₩250M
```
✅ Normal - most properties have one primary mortgage

**Multiple mortgages (2순위, 3순위):**
```
1st Mortgage: ₩200M (1순위)
2nd Mortgage: ₩50M  (2순위)
3rd Mortgage: ₩30M  (3순위)
─────────────────────────────
Total: ₩280M
```
⚠️ Warning - multiple mortgages suggest:
- Owner needed additional loans (financial stress)
- Higher interest rates (2nd/3rd mortgages are more expensive)
- Higher default risk

### Cancelled Mortgages (말소)

```
1        근저당권설정   2020년3월1일   ...  채권최고액: ₩150,000,000
         Mortgage      March 1, 2020       Creditor: Woori Bank

2        말소          2023년7월18일  2023년7월18일  변제
         Cancellation  July 18, 2023  July 18, 2023  (Paid off)
```

**Translation:** Original ₩150M mortgage was paid off on July 18, 2023.

**What it means:**
✅ GOOD - old debt was cleared
✅ Often happens when property sells (new owner pays off seller's mortgage)
✅ You can ignore cancelled (말소) entries

---

## Common Red Flags in Section B

### 🚫 Red Flag 1: 전세권설정 (Registered Jeonse Right)

```
1        전세권설정    2023년8월1일   ...  전세금: ₩200,000,000
         Jeonse Right  Aug 1, 2023        Deposit: ₩200,000,000
         Registered                       Tenant: John Smith
```

**What it means:** A previous jeonse tenant registered their lease right.

**Why it's a problem:**
- That tenant's ₩200M has priority over your deposit
- Landlord is trying to double-collect jeonse
- Property might have ₩200M + ₩150M (yours) = ₩350M in tenant deposits

**Action:** Verify this jeonse right is cancelled (말소) before signing. If not, WALK AWAY.

### 🚫 Red Flag 2: 가압류 / 압류 (Seizure)

```
2        가압류        2024년11월15일  서울남부지방법원  채권자: XYZ건설
         Provisional   Nov 15, 2024    Seoul Nam Court   Creditor: XYZ Construction
         Seizure                                         Amount: ₩80,000,000
```

**What it means:** XYZ Construction sued owner for ₩80M, court froze the property.

**Why it's a problem:**
- Property cannot be sold until seizure is resolved
- Creditor may force auction
- You'll lose deposit if auction happens

**Action:** 🚫 WALK AWAY - Do not rent property with active seizure.

### 🚫 Red Flag 3: Multiple Recent Mortgages

```
1        근저당권설정   2023년7월25일  ...  채권최고액: ₩200,000,000

2        근저당권설정   2024년2월10일  ...  채권최고액: ₩50,000,000

3        근저당권설정   2024년8월5일   ...  채권최고액: ₩40,000,000
```

**Pattern:** Owner took 3 mortgages within 13 months, each getting smaller.

**What it suggests:**
- Owner is financially desperate
- Each new mortgage has higher interest rate
- Default risk is HIGH

**Action:** ⚠️ Extreme caution - likely to avoid.

## Real Example Analysis

Let's analyze a complete 등기부등본:

### Property Details:
- **Location:** Gangnam, Seoul
- **Type:** 84㎡ apartment
- **Market value:** ₩420,000,000 (verified on MOLIT)

### Section A (갑구):
```
1  소유권보존  2015년5월10일  소유자: 김철수
2  소유권이전  2023년3월15일  매매  소유자: 이영희
```

**Analysis:**
✅ Previous owner held 8 years (stable)
✅ Current owner has it 1.5 years (acceptable)
✅ Normal sale (매매)
✅ No seizures or restrictions

### Section B (을구):
```
1  근저당권설정  2023년3월20일  채권최고액: ₩240,000,000
   채권자: 국민은행

2  근저당권설정  2024년10월1일  채권최고액: ₩60,000,000
   채권자: 우리은행
```

**Analysis:**
- Total mortgages: ₩300,000,000
- Property value: ₩420,000,000
- Mortgage ratio: 71%
- Your deposit: ₩180,000,000
- Total claims: ₩480,000,000 (114% of value!)

**Risk Calculation:**
```
If property sells for ₩420M:
- 1st mortgage gets: ₩240M
- 2nd mortgage gets: ₩60M
- Remaining for you: ₩120M
- YOU LOSE: ₩60M
```

**Final Assessment:** 🚫 **HIGH RISK - DO NOT PROCEED**

**Reasons:**
1. Total mortgages (71%) too high
2. Recent 2nd mortgage (Oct 2024) suggests financial stress
3. Your deposit + mortgages exceed property value
4. Low margin for error

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need the 등기부등본 for wolse (monthly rent) too?**
A: Yes, recommended. While wolse deposits are smaller, you should still verify the landlord actually owns the property.

**Q: How recent should the 등기부등본 be?**
A: Get it within 7 days of signing the contract. Mortgages can be added quickly.

**Q: Can the landlord fake the 등기부등본?**
A: Difficult to fake because it has official ID (고유번호) you can verify at iros.go.kr.

**Q: What if I can't access iros.go.kr from outside Korea?**
A: Use VPN or ask real estate agent to provide it. Agent should give you this as part of their service.

**Q: Do all properties have mortgages?**
A: No. Some owners pay cash. 0% mortgage is the safest scenario for jeonse.

**Q: What if mortgage was 50% when I signed but landlord adds more later?**
A: This is why you must register your lease (전입신고 + 확정일자). Registration gives you priority over mortgages added AFTER your confirmation date.

**Q: Can I check 등기부등본 before viewing the apartment?**
A: If you have the exact address, yes. But usually you get it after deciding you're interested.

**Q: What's the difference between 등기부등본 and 초본?**
A:
- 등본 (deungbon) = Entire Household (get this one)
- 초본 (chobon) = Just Applicant's History
- Always request 등본 for complete information

## Common Mistakes Foreigners Make

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not Getting 등기부등본 at All
**Why it's bad:** You have no idea if property is safe
**Fix:** ALWAYS get it before signing

### ❌ Mistake 2: Getting it Too Early
**Why it's bad:** Landlord can add mortgages after you checked
**Fix:** Get it within 7 days of signing

### ❌ Mistake 3: Only Checking Ownership, Not Mortgages
**Why it's bad:** Section B (mortgages) is also as important as Section A
**Fix:** Focus on calculating total debts

### ❌ Mistake 4: Trusting Agent's Summary
**Why it's bad:** Agent works for landlord, may hide problems
**Fix:** Read the actual document yourself or use verification tool

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Verifying Property Value
**Why it's bad:** Mortgage % is meaningless without knowing true value
**Fix:** Always check MOLIT transaction data

### ❌ Mistake 6: Ignoring "Small" Red Flags
**Why it's bad:** Small warning signs often predict big problems
**Fix:** Take every red flag seriously
