"It won't happen to me."

That's what Sarah thought when she signed a jeonse contract for ₩250 million in Gangnam. The apartment was beautiful, the landlord seemed trustworthy, and her Korean coworker said the area was safe.

Eighteen months later, Sarah lost ₩230 million when the building was auctioned to pay off the landlord's debts.

**Jeonse fraud isn't a distant threat—it's happening right now in Seoul, and foreigners are prime targets.**

This article documents 10 real jeonse fraud cases from 2024-2025, with names changed but details authentic. Each case includes:
- What happened
- How much was lost
- Warning signs that were missed
- How it could have been prevented

## Understanding the Jeonse Fraud Crisis

### The Scale of the Problem

**2024 Statistics (Korea Ministry of Justice):**
- ₩3.2 trillion in total jeonse fraud losses nationwide
- 23,000+ victims reported
- Average loss per victim: ₩139 million
- Foreign victim rate: 2.8x higher than Korean nationals

**Why foreigners are targeted:**
- Can't read property registers (등기부등본)
- Don't know Korean real estate laws
- Trust agents and landlords without verification
- Feel pressure to secure housing quickly
- Often have significant savings (visa/work requirements)

### Common Fraud Patterns

1. **Underwater Property Scam** - Mortgages exceed property value
2. **Rapid Flip Scam** - Buy property, immediately lease, default on mortgage
3. **Multiple Jeonse Scam** - Collect deposits from multiple tenants
4. **Fake Owner Scam** - Impersonate property owner
5. **Hidden Lien Scam** - Property has undisclosed legal claims

Let's examine real cases of each type.

## Case 1: The Gangnam Underwater Property

**Victim:** Sarah K., 34, English teacher from Canada
**Location:** Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu
**Deposit:** ₩250,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩232,000,000
**Date:** March 2024

### What Happened

Sarah found a beautiful 2-bedroom apartment near Samsung station. The landlord was a well-dressed businessman who spoke basic English. The real estate agent assured her the area was "very safe" and "high value."

**Contract details:**
- Deposit: ₩250M
- Market value (agent claimed): ₩450M
- Actual market value: ₩380M
- Hidden mortgages: ₩320M

**Timeline:**
- **March 2023:** Sarah signs contract and pays ₩250M deposit
- **March 2023:** She moves in but doesn't register her lease (agent said "not necessary for foreigners")
- **July 2024:** Receives notice that building is being auctioned
- **September 2024:** Discovers property has ₩320M in mortgages
- **November 2024:** Auction proceeds are ₩370M
- **December 2024:** After mortgage holders paid, Sarah receives ₩18M back

**Total loss: ₩232 million**

### Warning Signs Sarah Missed

❌ Never requested property register (등기부등본)
❌ Trusted agent's verbal property value estimate
❌ Didn't register her lease within 14 days
❌ No confirmation date stamp (확정일자)
❌ Deposit was 66% of claimed value (too high)

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Get property register before signing - would have shown ₩320M mortgages
✅ Verify market value on MOLIT website - would have shown ₩380M, not ₩450M
✅ Calculate: ₩320M mortgage + ₩250M deposit = ₩570M claims on ₩380M property = DANGER
✅ Register lease immediately - would have given her priority over later mortgages
✅ Walk away when numbers don't add up

**Lesson:** Always verify property register. Verbal assurances mean nothing.

## Case 2: The Hongdae Rapid Flip

**Victim:** Michael T., 28, software engineer from USA
**Location:** Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu
**Deposit:** ₩180,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩180,000,000 (total loss)
**Date:** June 2024

### What Happened

Michael found a newly renovated officetel near Hongik University. The landlord explained he had recently purchased it as an investment property and renovated it for rental.

**The scam:**
- **May 2024:** Scammer buys property for ₩250M with ₩230M mortgage (92% LTV)
- **May 2024:** Spends ₩10M on cosmetic renovation
- **June 2024:** Immediately seeks jeonse tenant
- **June 2024:** Michael signs, pays ₩180M, moves in
- **June 2024:** Michael registers his lease (good!)
- **August 2024:** Landlord stops paying mortgage
- **January 2025:** Bank forecloses, property auctioned
- **February 2025:** Auction price: ₩220M (market decline)
- **February 2025:** Bank takes entire ₩220M for mortgage
- **February 2025:** Michael gets ₩0

### Warning Signs Michael Missed

❌ Landlord owned property for only 1 month
❌ Property had 92% mortgage (extremely high)
❌ Landlord was unusually eager to rent quickly
❌ Too-good-to-be-true rental terms
❌ Didn't calculate combined debt vs. value

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Check property register ownership history - would have shown purchase was 1 month prior
✅ See ₩230M mortgage on ₩250M property (92% LTV) = instant red flag
✅ Calculate: ₩230M mortgage + ₩180M deposit = ₩410M claims on ₩250M property
✅ Walk away from any property owned < 6 months
✅ Recognize pattern: rapid purchase → immediate rental → default

**Lesson:** Recent ownership change + high mortgage = classic fraud pattern.

## Case 3: The Sinchon Multiple Jeonse Scam

**Victims:** Emma L. (UK), David C. (Australia), Yuki S. (Japan)
**Location:** Sinchon-dong, Seodaemun-gu
**Deposits:** ₩150M each (₩450M total)
**Amount Lost:** ₩135M each (₩405M total)
**Date:** September 2024

### What Happened

Three foreign professionals separately found the same apartment through different agents. The landlord showed the apartment to each person on different days and signed contracts with all three for the same unit.

**The scam:**
- Landlord owns property worth ₩280M with ₩200M mortgage
- Lists property with 3 different real estate agencies
- Shows apartment to Emma on Monday (she signs, pays ₩150M)
- Shows to David on Wednesday (he signs, pays ₩150M)
- Shows to Yuki on Friday (she signs, pays ₩150M)
- Landlord collects ₩450M total for one ₩280M property
- Landlord disappears with ₩250M profit (₩450M - ₩200M mortgage)

**Timeline:**
- **Sept 1:** Emma signs contract, scheduled move-in Sept 15
- **Sept 3:** David signs contract, scheduled move-in Sept 20
- **Sept 5:** Yuki signs contract, scheduled move-in Sept 22
- **Sept 15:** Emma arrives to move in, landlord delays ("cleaning")
- **Sept 20:** David arrives, discovers Emma's belongings
- **Sept 22:** Yuki arrives, discovers two other tenants
- **Sept 23:** All three realize they've been scammed
- **Sept 25:** Landlord phone disconnected, disappeared
- **October 2024:** Police investigation begins
- **December 2024:** Property auctioned for ₩270M
- **January 2025:** After ₩200M mortgage paid, ₩70M distributed among 3 victims

**Each victim receives: ₩23M (lost ₩127M each)**

### Warning Signs All Three Missed

❌ None registered their lease before move-in day
❌ All paid full deposit before receiving keys
❌ Didn't visit property registration office to check existing leases
❌ Trusted different agents without independent verification
❌ No one verified landlord's identity against property register

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Register lease IMMEDIATELY after signing (reveals if others already registered)
✅ Visit district office to check for existing registered tenants
✅ Only pay deposit on move-in day after receiving keys
✅ Verify landlord ID matches property register owner
✅ Get confirmation date stamp to establish priority

**Lesson:** Register your lease the same day you sign. It prevents multiple jeonse fraud.

## Case 4: The Fake Landlord Scam

**Victim:** Thomas B., 31, financial analyst from Germany
**Location:** Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu
**Deposit:** ₩200,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩200,000,000 (total loss)
**Date:** August 2024

### What Happened

Thomas viewed a luxury apartment in Seocho. The "landlord" - a sophisticated, English-speaking man in his 50s - claimed to own multiple properties in Seoul.

**The scam:**
- Scammer identifies empty apartment (real owner is overseas)
- Scammer bribes building security guard for access
- Scammer creates fake ID and property documents
- Shows apartment to Thomas, everything looks perfect
- Thomas pays ₩200M via wire transfer to scammer's account
- Scammer provides contract and "keys" (actually copies made earlier)
- Keys don't work when Thomas tries to move in
- Real owner returns to Seoul, has no idea about Thomas
- Scammer disappears, untraceable

### Warning Signs Thomas Missed

❌ Never verified landlord's ID against property register
❌ Paid into personal account without verifying account holder name
❌ Didn't check property register at all
❌ Met at property, not at landlord's office/home
❌ Contract didn't have official seal/notarization

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Get property register first - shows real owner's name
✅ Verify landlord's Korean ID matches property register owner name exactly
✅ Only pay to bank account matching registered owner name
✅ Meet at landlord's registered address or office
✅ Demand to see original property deed (not just contract)

**Lesson:** Always verify landlord identity against property register. No exceptions.

## Case 5: The Hidden Lien Disaster

**Victim:** Jennifer W., 29, UN worker from USA
**Location:** Jongno-gu
**Deposit:** ₩160,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩95,000,000
**Date:** January 2024

### What Happened

Jennifer found an apartment through a reputable relocation agency. She did her due diligence: got the property register, saw only one ₩100M mortgage (safe!), verified ownership, and signed confidently.

**What she didn't know:**
- Property had ₩80M in unpaid property taxes (not yet registered)
- Landlord had undisclosed business debts
- Creditor filed seizure one week after Jennifer signed

**Timeline:**
- **Jan 15, 2024:** Jennifer gets property register - shows ₩100M mortgage only
- **Jan 20, 2024:** Jennifer signs contract and pays ₩160M
- **Jan 25, 2024:** Jennifer registers her lease (good!)
- **Jan 27, 2024:** Court files seizure (가압류) for ₩80M in tax debt
- **March 2024:** Additional creditor files lien for ₩60M
- **June 2024:** Property auctioned
- **July 2024:** Auction proceeds: ₩310M
- **Distribution:**
  - Tax authority: ₩80M (priority)
  - 1st mortgage: ₩100M
  - 2nd creditor: ₩60M
  - Jennifer: ₩65M (lost ₩95M)

### Warning Signs That Were Invisible

This case is particularly insidious because Jennifer did everything right:
✅ Got property register
✅ Verified ownership
✅ Registered lease immediately
✅ Got confirmation date stamp

**The problem:** Liens can be filed AFTER you check property register but BEFORE you register your lease.

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Get property register within 24 hours of signing (not 5 days before)
✅ Check for tax delinquency at district office (separate from property register)
✅ Get jeonse insurance (HUG) - would have covered the loss
✅ Include clause in contract requiring landlord to warrant no hidden debts
✅ Verify landlord's credit status if possible

**Lesson:** Even perfect due diligence has gaps. Get insurance for large deposits.

## Case 6: The Sweet-Talking Agent

**Victim:** Maria S., 26, graduate student from Spain
**Location:** Gwanak-gu (near SNU)
**Deposit:** ₩85,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩85,000,000 (total loss)
**Date:** March 2024

### What Happened

Maria's real estate agent was incredibly helpful - drove her around, explained everything, even helped with paperwork in English. When Maria asked for the property register, the agent said "Oh, I already checked it for you, everything is perfect!"

**The reality:**
- Agent was working with landlord in fraud scheme
- Property had ₩150M in mortgages (agent never showed Maria)
- Property value: ₩160M
- Agent kept showing Maria other documents to avoid property register request
- Maria trusted the agent and signed

**Commission split:**
- Landlord collected ₩85M deposit
- Property immediately went into foreclosure (planned)
- Agent received ₩5M commission from landlord
- They disappeared together
- Maria lost everything

### Warning Signs Maria Missed

❌ Trusted agent to verify instead of seeing documents herself
❌ Agent was unusually pushy and friendly
❌ Never actually saw the property register with her own eyes
❌ Agent discouraged her from getting lawyer review
❌ Agent offered to handle "all the paperwork"

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Never trust agent's word - demand to see actual documents
✅ Get property register yourself from iros.go.kr
✅ Remember: agent works for landlord, not for you
✅ If agent resists showing documents, find different agent
✅ Get independent verification from lawyer or service

**Lesson:** Friendly agent ≠ trustworthy agent. Always verify independently.

## Case 7: The Auction Timing Trap

**Victim:** Raj P., 35, professor from India
**Location:** Nowon-gu
**Deposit:** ₩120,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩78,000,000
**Date:** May 2024

### What Happened

Raj did his homework: checked property register (₩80M mortgage, safe!), verified ownership, registered his lease, got confirmation date stamp. Everything perfect.

**What went wrong:**
- Unknown to Raj, property was already in auction proceedings
- Auction process had started 3 months before Raj signed
- Property register didn't show auction status (separate system)
- Landlord collected Raj's deposit knowing auction was coming
- Auction completed 4 months after Raj moved in

### Timeline:
- **February 2024:** Bank starts foreclosure (landlord stopped paying mortgage)
- **May 2024:** Raj signs contract (property register looks fine)
- **May 2024:** Raj registers lease and gets confirmation date
- **September 2024:** Auction completes at ₩190M
- **Distribution:**
  - Auction costs: ₩8M
  - 1st mortgage: ₩80M
  - Small creditors: ₩20M
  - Raj: ₩42M (lost ₩78M)

### Warning Signs Raj Missed

❌ Didn't check auction status (separate from property register)
❌ Landlord was oddly eager to rent (should have questioned why)
❌ Didn't notice landlord seemed financially desperate
❌ No insurance

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Check auction status at court auction website: ggi.go.kr
✅ Search property address on auction site before signing
✅ Ask landlord directly: "Is this property in any legal proceedings?"
✅ Get HUG insurance - would have covered the loss
✅ Be suspicious if landlord is overly eager

**Lesson:** Property register doesn't show auction status. Check auction website separately.

## Case 8: The Redevelopment Zone Trap

**Victim:** Sophie M., 30, designer from France
**Location:** Gangbuk-gu
**Deposit:** ₩95,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩55,000,000
**Date:** July 2024

### What Happened

Sophie found an affordable apartment in an older neighborhood. The landlord mentioned the area was "being developed soon" which sounded exciting. What Sophie didn't realize: this was a red flag.

**The issue:**
- Area designated for redevelopment within 1 year
- Building would be demolished
- All tenants evicted with 6 months notice
- Property value would decline during transition
- Landlord knew this, Sophie didn't

### Timeline:
- **July 2024:** Sophie signs 2-year jeonse contract
- **September 2024:** Official redevelopment announcement
- **December 2024:** All tenants receive eviction notice (6 months)
- **February 2025:** Sophie must move out (contract only 7 months old)
- **March 2025:** Sophie demands deposit return
- **March 2025:** Landlord says "building hasn't sold yet, can't return deposit"
- **June 2025:** Building demolished, land sold for ₩210M
- **June 2025:** After debts paid, Sophie receives ₩40M back

### Warning Signs Sophie Missed

❌ Didn't research neighborhood development plans
❌ "Being developed" should have triggered investigation
❌ Deposit was low for Seoul (should have questioned why)
❌ Didn't check district office for redevelopment designations
❌ No clause in contract protecting against early termination

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Check Seoul city development plans at urban planning office
✅ Google area + "재개발" (redevelopment) before signing
✅ Be suspicious of low deposits in Seoul (usually means problems)
✅ Include contract clause requiring landlord to refund deposit if building sold
✅ Avoid areas marked for redevelopment unless contract protects you

**Lesson:** Low deposit = investigate why. Redevelopment areas are high risk.

## Case 9: The Corporate Landlord Bankruptcy

**Victim:** 15 foreign tenants (various nationalities)
**Location:** Multiple buildings in Yeongdeungpo-gu
**Deposits:** ₩100M-₩200M each (₩2.1B total)
**Amount Lost:** ₩50M-₩150M each (₩1.3B total)
**Date:** October 2024

### What Happened

A real estate investment company owned 12 apartment buildings and leased units on jeonse. The company seemed legitimate: registered business, professional office, English-speaking staff.

**The collapse:**
- Company over-leveraged properties (80%+ mortgages)
- Used new jeonse deposits to pay off previous tenant deposits (Ponzi structure)
- Real estate market declined 10% in 2024
- Company couldn't refinance mortgages
- Filed bankruptcy in October 2024
- All properties auctioned

**Victim profile:**
- Mostly professionals at international companies
- All did basic due diligence (property register check)
- All registered leases properly
- Still lost 40-60% of deposits

### Warning Signs Tenants Missed

❌ Didn't realize landlord was corporation, not individual (higher bankruptcy risk)
❌ Didn't check company's financial statements
❌ Multiple buildings owned by same entity (systemic risk)
❌ High mortgage ratios (60-80%) across all properties

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Check if landlord is company vs. individual
✅ If company: request financial statements
✅ Google company name + "재무" (finances) for news
✅ Be extra cautious with corporate landlords
✅ MUST get jeonse insurance for corporate landlords
✅ Diversify - don't rent from company that owns entire building

**Lesson:** Corporate landlords have different risks. Require more scrutiny and insurance.

## Case 10: The COVID Financial Collapse

**Victim:** James K., 33, restaurant owner from Canada
**Location:** Itaewon, Yongsan-gu
**Deposit:** ₩170,000,000
**Amount Lost:** ₩110,000,000
**Date:** Signed 2022, collapsed 2024

### What Happened

James signed a jeonse contract in March 2022 when everything looked good. Property was ₩320M, mortgage was ₩120M (safe 37.5% ratio), landlord was stable business owner.

**Then COVID recovery hit:**
- Landlord's business (restaurant chain) struggled
- Landlord took additional mortgages (₩80M in 2023)
- Landlord borrowed against property (₩60M in 2024)
- Total debt reached ₩260M
- Business failed, landlord declared bankruptcy
- Property auctioned for ₩280M (market decline)

### Timeline:
- **March 2022:** James signs, property looks safe
- **March 2022:** ₩120M mortgage (37.5% LTV - SAFE)
- **June 2023:** Landlord adds ₩80M 2nd mortgage
- **January 2024:** Landlord adds ₩60M 3rd mortgage
- **Total debt now:** ₩260M + James's ₩170M = ₩430M
- **March 2024:** James's lease expires, requests deposit return
- **April 2024:** Landlord can't pay, files bankruptcy
- **August 2024:** Auction at ₩280M
- **Distribution:**
  - 1st mortgage: ₩120M
  - 2nd mortgage: ₩80M
  - James: ₩60M (lost ₩110M)
  - 3rd mortgage: ₩20M (partial)

**James had confirmation date:** July 2023 (before 3rd mortgage)
**But 2nd mortgage was before his date:** This took priority

### Warning Signs James Missed

❌ Didn't monitor property register during lease term
❌ Assumed safe initial conditions would remain safe
❌ No jeonse insurance
❌ Didn't renew confirmation date stamp annually

### How It Could Have Been Prevented

✅ Check property register every 6 months during lease
✅ If new mortgages appear, demand early return of deposit
✅ Get jeonse insurance even when property initially looks safe
✅ Include contract clause limiting additional mortgages
✅ Renew confirmation date stamp annually

**Lesson:** Safe property can become unsafe. Monitor throughout your lease.
